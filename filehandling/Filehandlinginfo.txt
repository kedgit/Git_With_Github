			**FileHandling in java**


Here is a hierarchical tree showing the main classes involved in Java I/O streams, divided into:

Byte Streams (InputStream / OutputStream)
Character Streams (Reader / Writer)

java.io
├── InputStream              ← abstract (for reading bytes)
│   ├── FileInputStream
│   ├── ByteArrayInputStream
│   ├── ObjectInputStream
│   └── BufferedInputStream
|
├── OutputStream             ← abstract (for writing bytes)
│   ├── FileOutputStream
│   ├── ByteArrayOutputStream
│   ├── ObjectOutputStream
│   └── BufferedOutputStream
|
├── Reader                   ← abstract (for reading characters)
│   ├── FileReader
│   ├── CharArrayReader
│   ├── StringReader
│   └── BufferedReader
|
├── Writer                   ← abstract (for writing characters)
│   ├── FileWriter
│   ├── CharArrayWriter
│   ├── StringWriter
│   └── BufferedWriter


FileInputStream		Read bytes from a file
FileOutputStream		Write bytes to a file
FileReader			Read characters from a file
FileWriter			Write characters to a file
BufferedReader		Read lines efficiently
BufferedWriter		Write text efficiently

🧠 Explanation:

Byte Streams:

Use InputStream and OutputStream
Work with raw binary data (e.g., images, files, videos)

Character Streams:

Use Reader and Writer
Work with text (character) data (e.g., .txt files)

Note:
When you open a file, the OS gives Java a handle to the file and knows the file size.
Every time you call read(), Java asks the OS to provide the next byte at the current position.
The OS tracks the read position internally.
When the read position reaches the file’s end (i.e., all bytes have been read), the OS signals there is no more data.
Java’s FileInputStream.read() method then returns -1 to indicate EOF.
